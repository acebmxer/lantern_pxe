"""Restore the database from a backup downloaded via GET /api/backup.

That backup is the SQLite file itself, so restoring is fundamentally a file
swap. Three things make it more than `cp`:

1. **Validation.** The uploaded file becomes the authentication database. A
   truncated download, an unrelated .db, or a backup whose users table holds no
   admin would each leave Lantern unable to log anyone in and no way back through
   the UI. Nothing is touched until the file passes every check.

2. **Host identity.** Most settings describe how the admin wants Lantern to
   behave and should come back verbatim. Two describe the *machine*:
   `server_ip` and `boot_interface`. bootstrap regenerates dnsmasq.conf from
   them on the next start, so a backup taken on other hardware means dnsmasq
   binds an interface that doesn't exist, or hands clients a next-server that
   isn't this box -- PXE breaks with nothing pointing at the cause. Both are
   checked against the host (services.hostinfo) and left out of the restore when
   they don't describe it.

3. **Restart.** SQLAlchemy's pool holds open handles to the live database file.
   Swapping the file underneath them leaves in-flight requests writing to an
   unlinked inode, where the writes silently vanish. Restarting the container
   makes startup the only thing that opens the restored file -- and startup
   already does the right work: bootstrap.run() adds settings a backup predates,
   reconcile_statuses() flags images whose extracted files are gone, and
   dnsmasq/ipxe render fresh config from the restored rows.

The flow is upload -> stage -> preview -> apply, so the admin sees what would
change and what would be rejected before committing. The staged file sits beside
the live database in DATA_DIR so the final swap is an atomic os.replace within a
single filesystem.
