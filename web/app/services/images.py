    Stock Windows 11 WinPE has no driver for Intel VMD / RST (or AMD RAID), so on
    machines that ship with those enabled in firmware — most laptops from Intel's
    11th gen on — Setup enumerates zero disks and stops at "we couldn't find any
    drives". The media is fine; WinPE just can't see the controller. (Linux is
    unaffected: it has both NVMe and VMD support in-kernel.)

    The drivers are staged locally and handed to Setup via an answer file
    (_unattend_xml -> `setup.exe /unattend`). Setup's windowsPE pass loads them
    as it starts — which is what populates the disk list — and reflects the
    matching boot-critical driver into the *installed* OS so it boots
    (otherwise: INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE / 0x7B). DriverPaths is PnP-matched
    and PnP-ranked: only the best driver for hardware actually present is
    used, which keeps a folder holding several vendors — or several versions —
    of a package safe. The copy is local so the pass never reads over SMB.

    We deliberately do NOT `drvload` these .infs ourselves. Force-loading a
    storage .inf live-binds a boot-critical miniport, and Setup's own windowsPE
    driver pass then re-services that same bound controller — which bugchecks
    WinPE on a real VMD/RAID machine the instant Setup starts (a VM without the
    controller never binds, so it never shows). The answer file alone is the
    supported path (it's how MDT/SCCM inject these) and populates the disk list
    just as early. The baked NIC sweep in _lantern_setup_cmd is different on
    purpose: it runs before networking exists, nothing is using the NIC yet, and
    NICs aren't boot-critical to WinPE (X: is a ramdisk).

    We also do NOT use `setup.exe /ReflectDrivers`: empirically it aborts the
    file-copy at ~5-8% with a generic "installation has failed" (a VM that
    installs cleanly with plain setup.exe fails the instant the flag is added).

    All of it is skipped when the share is absent or holds no .inf, so an empty
    drivers folder costs nothing and Setup runs exactly as before.
