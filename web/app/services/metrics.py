"""Host performance metrics read straight from /proc (no external deps).

If the deployment mounts the host's /proc read-only at HOST_PROC, these numbers
reflect the whole machine -- including whatever pushes images to clients -- not
just this container. If HOST_PROC isn't mounted we fall back to the container's
own /proc, which still works but only shows this container's own load.

Rates (CPU%, disk B/s, network B/s) are deltas between successive reads, so the
first call after startup returns zero rates; the dashboard polls on an interval
and gets live numbers from the second sample onward.
