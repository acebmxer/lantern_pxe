"""Recent PXE clients, parsed from dnsmasq's DHCP log.

Works in BOTH dnsmasq modes -- including proxyDHCP, where no lease file exists
(your existing DHCP server hands out addresses) and the log is the only record
that a client asked us to boot. dnsmasq runs with `log-dhcp` and is configured
to write to a file under DNSMASQ_DIR (see services/dnsmasq.py); we read the
tail of that file here.

We don't keep a daemon tailing the file -- the dashboard polls, and parsing the
last slice of a log on each poll is cheap and stateless.
