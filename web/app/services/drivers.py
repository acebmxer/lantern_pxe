"""Drop-in Windows storage drivers: list, upload (zip or loose files), delete.

The folder is a host bind (./data/drivers, see compose.yml) that an SMB share
re-exports read-only as install\\drivers. At boot WinPE maps it as Z:, drvloads
every .inf it finds, and hands the set to Setup via an answer file — see
services.images._driver_lines for the full story.

Nothing here touches an image. The batch script baked into boot.wim scans the
share at boot time, so drivers uploaded now apply to the next boot of *every*
Windows image, with no re-extraction and no container restart (the bind mount
is live wherever it's shared from).
