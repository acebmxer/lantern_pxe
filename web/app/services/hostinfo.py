"""What the host actually looks like: NIC names and configured IPv4 addresses.

Read from the host's /proc (mounted read-only at HOST_PROC, when the deployment
mounts it), and specifically through PID 1: /proc/net is a symlink to self/net
and follows the reading task's network namespace, so the web container's own
net/ lists its veth rather than the host's NICs. PID 1 in the host's /proc is
the host init, which lives in the root netns. Same reason metrics._net_dev_path
goes through PID 1.

Used by services.restore to decide whether a backup's server_ip and
boot_interface describe *this* machine before restoring them.

Both lookups return an empty set when the host /proc isn't mounted or isn't
readable. Callers must treat empty as "cannot verify" and fall back to trusting
the value -- never as "nothing matched", which would reject every value on a
host whose /proc simply isn't visible.
